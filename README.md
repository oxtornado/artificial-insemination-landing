## What ✨
A clean, responsive landing page for a livestock artificial insemination service. Turns complex agricultural services into something visually appealing with a hero section, benefit cards, and step-by-step process breakdown.

## Why 💡
Needed to bring traditional farming services online with a modern touch. Agricultural businesses deserve sleek websites too! Plus, it was perfect for flexing those Bootstrap + custom CSS muscles.

## How 🛠️
- **HTML5** - Structure
- **CSS3** - Custom vibes
- **Bootstrap 5.3.6** - Responsive magic
- **Minimal JS** - Just the essentials

## Things I Learned 🧠

### CSS Tricks
- Hero magic with `background-size: cover` and overlay effects
- Frosted glass effect using `backdrop-filter: blur(5px)`
- That cool `inset: 0` shorthand beats writing four separate properties
- Z-index layering for perfect element stacking

### Bootstrap Superpowers
- Responsive grid that shifts from 2 to 4 columns as screen grows
- Utility classes that saved hours of custom CSS:
  - `d-flex align-items-center` = centered content without the headache
  - `text-white p-5 rounded-3 fw-bold` = instant style
- Navbar that collapses on mobile without writing media queries
- Cards that maintain equal height with `h-100`

Built this while vibing to lofi beats. Fork it if you need to make farming look cool online! 🌱
